// How to:
// Each room is a 5x5 block. 
// Above the room we have a bitmap of North, East, South, West. A bit of 1 means there is an entrance/exit in this direction.
// The constraint is traversal from one tile to adjacent tiles must be possible.
// In technical terms, this constraint is modelled as: Adjacent rooms must have their bitwise-multiplication result (=logical AND operation) be non-zero.
// Explanation: Using the bits, we can use room A bitwise-AND room B to determine whether the two rooms can be matched. If the result is 0 (0000), then they are not compatible so cannot be matched. Otherwise they can be matched.
// Remember: We have diagonal movement so the exit can be slightly off-center and still count as an exit.
// Legend: w = wall, . = floor
